# Chess

This was an assignment from The Odin Project. Managing all of the different scenarios that can occur in a game of chess was incredibly difficult, but I learned a lot about dealing with many different cases and specific interactions. Stalemate and en passent still need to be implemented. Something that I became aware of while working on this project is how important it is to keep everything properly organized.
